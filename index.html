                <p>
                    N'djar is an integrated system (digital platform) associated with the Agricultural Land Suitability Assessment system that uses technological channels for the dissemination and distribution of various agricultural information and statistics for the efficient 
                    and appropriate use of the national productive force of soils and lands. It is based on the interpretation of soil vocation, environmental characteristics, and the assessment of land limitations for agricultural use. The platform aims to provide the most 
                    suitable use possibilities for a given area, considering different alternatives for management practices.
                    The name "N'djar" has a local significance, as it means "Farmer" in the Pepel dialect of Guinea-Bissau, which highlights the platform's focus on supporting the agricultural community.
