## Overview

N'djar is an integrated system (digital platform) associated with the Agricultural Land Suitability Assessment system that uses technological channels for the dissemination and distribution of various agricultural information and statistics for the efficient and appropriate use of the national productive force of soils and lands. It is based on the interpretation of soil vocation, environmental characteristics, and the assessment of land limitations for agricultural use. The platform aims to provide the most suitable use possibilities for a given area, considering different alternatives for management practices.

Through N'djar, users can access information such as what, how, and where to produce, soil vocation, and suitable cultivation for each cultivation plot. The distribution system includes a 3-digit USSD number, APK mobile applications, and technical assistance.

## Testing

A thorough testing process has been carried out to guarantee that the site functions properly and offers a positive user experience. The project's features, functionality, and responsiveness across various browsers and screen sizes were the main emphasis of the testing procedure.

### Feature Testing
- Navigation Menu (responsivity)
- Main Image (zoom in, responsivity)
- Service (responsivity)
- Team (responsivity)


### Responsiveness Testing

The following browsers were used to test the website for compatibility and uniform appearance:

- Mozilla Firefox 
- Google Chrome
- Safari 
- Microsoft Edge

In addition, the site's responsiveness was examined across a range of screen sizes, including those of mobile devices and huge desktop monitors.

### Validator Testing

#### HTML
by running the test at https://validator.w3.org/ i found error below and i remove the element h3 to fixed the error.

Error: Element h3 not allowed as child of element button in this context. (Suppressing further errors from this subtree.)

From line 46, column 21; to line 46, column 24

  <button><h3>Try it

#### CSS
when using the css validator https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator I found this error below, and to fix it I removed the px since "400px" is not a valid value for this property. The font-weight property accepts unitless numbers and predefined weight names
"12 body Value error : font-weight 400px is not a value font-weight : 400px"

## Deployment
The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:
- Log in to your GitHub account and go to the main page of your repository.

- Click on "Save."
- The page will refresh, and after a few moments, you will see a message stating that the deployment was successful. The live link to your site will be provided just below this message.
