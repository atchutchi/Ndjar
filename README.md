## Overview

N'djar is an integrated system (digital platform) associated with the Agricultural Land Suitability Assessment system that uses technological channels for the dissemination and distribution of various agricultural information and statistics for the efficient and appropriate use of the national productive force of soils and lands. It is based on the interpretation of soil vocation, environmental characteristics, and the assessment of land limitations for agricultural use. The platform aims to provide the most suitable use possibilities for a given area, considering different alternatives for management practices.

Through N'djar, users can access information such as what, how, and where to produce, soil vocation, and suitable cultivation for each cultivation plot. The distribution system includes a 3-digit USSD number, APK mobile applications, and technical assistance.
